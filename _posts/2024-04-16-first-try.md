Hey everyone!  

So, I'm currently taking this cool course on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, and we've got this assignment to create our own GitHub blog. Honestly, this feels like a perfect opportunity to finally start something I've been thinking about for a while—summarizing and cataloging the stuff I've worked on.  

Previously, I always wanted to document my learning journey for easier review later on. This meant digging through past reports and revisiting some of the LaTeX quotes I used back then. Going forward, I plan to upload a bunch of content to this blog to keep everything organized and easily accessible.  

Of course, I won't be dumping every single assignment or MATLAB code directly onto the blog. That would be way too risky... Instead, I'll focus on sharing insights that might be helpful to others venturing into similar territories.  

Stay tuned for more posts where I'll dive deeper into specific projects and learning experiences. Can't wait to share more with you all.  

Cheers,  
Lawrence
