This is Lawrence, a Master student studying electrical engineering at the University of Queensland in Australia, I finished my Bachelor degree in University of New South Wales. Also, I have completed internships in various fields, for example, I worked as a Retail Management Assistant at a Chinese bank, and I interned at an Australian solar energy company, where I was involved in designing residential solar systems etc.<br>

I focused on the thesis topic in my Bachelor degree and it is about the physical layer security of Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Modulation (OTFS), a novel technology has been proved significant advantages over the traditional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation used in 4G and 5G in high Doppler environments, which achieves better spectral efficiency due to its ability to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI). <br>

Also, there are a lot of projects I have done before, for example<br>
- Brain-Computer Interface System<br>
Design of a basic brain-computer interface system for decoding EEG signals into speech<br>

- Distribution Network Design in Power Energy Supply System<br>
Design of three-phase grid with dual inverters including PLL, PID control design for grid-forming inverters and feed-in inverters.<br>

- Cochlear Implant Signal Processing<br>
Speech signal analysis and pitch detection for cochlear implants by designing FIR and IIR filter models.<br>

- Smart Fish Tank System and Product Design<br>
  - Products for the use of microcontroller to achieve temperature detection, pumping and drainage, water temperature heating, water level monitoring and a series of intelligent fish tank functions.<br>
  - Designing product features through selling point analyses and consumer surveys.<br>
  - Analyse product design budgets and product competitiveness through financial, human resource and market research.<br>

etc...<br>
